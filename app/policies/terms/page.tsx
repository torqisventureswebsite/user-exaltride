              Platform for Transaction and Communication
              The Platform enables the Buyer and Seller to transact on the Platform. Torqis is not and cannot
              be a party to or control in any manner any transaction between the Platform's Users.
              Henceforward:
              All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Buyers and
              Sellers alone. The commercial/contractual terms include without limitation price, shipping
              costs, payment methods, payment terms, date, period and mode of delivery, warranties
              related to products and services and after sales services related to products and
              services. Torqis does not have any control or does not determine or advise or in any way
              involve itself in the offering or acceptance of such commercial/contractual terms between
              the Buyers and Sellers. All product discounts, offers (including exchange offers) are by
              the Seller/Brand and not by Torqis.
              Placement of order by a Buyer with Seller on the Platform is an offer to buy the
              product(s) in by the Buyer to the Seller and it shall not be construed as Seller's
              acceptance of Buyer's offer to buy the product(s) ordered. The Seller retains the right to
              cancel any such order placed by the Buyer, at its sole discretion and the Buyer shall be
              intimated of the same by way of an email/SMS. Any transaction price paid by Buyer in
              case of such cancellation by Seller, shall be refunded to the Buyer. Further, the Seller
              may cancel an order wherein the quantities exceed the typical individual consumption.
              This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing
              of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity
              that exceeds the typical individual consumption. What comprises a typical individual's
              consumption quantity limit shall be based on various factors and at the sole discretion of
              the Seller and may vary from individual to individual.
              Torqis does not make any representation or Warranty as to specifics (such as quality,
              value, saleability, etc) of the products or services proposed to be sold or offered to be
              sold or purchased on the Platform. Torqis does not implicitly or explicitly support or
              endorse the sale or purchase of any products or services on the Platform. Torqis accepts
              no liability for any errors or omissions, whether on behalf of itself or third parties.

              between Buyers and Sellers. Torqis cannot and does not guarantee that the concerned
              Buyers and/or Sellers will perform any transaction concluded on the Platform. Torqis shall
              not and is not required to mediate or resolve any dispute or disagreement between
              Buyers and Sellers.

              legal title, creditworthiness, identity, etc) of any of its Users. You are advised to
              independently verify the bona fides of any particular User that You choose to deal with on
              the Platform and use Your best judgment in that behalf.
              Torqis does not at any point of time during any transaction between Buyer and Seller on
              the Platform come into or take possession of any of the products or services offered by
              Seller nor does it at any point gain title to or have any rights or claims over the products
              or services offered by Seller to Buyer.
              At no time shall Torqis hold any right, title or interest over the products nor shall Torqis
              have any obligations or liabilities in respect of such contract entered into between Buyers
              and Sellers. Torqis is not responsible for unsatisfactory or delayed performance of
              services or damages or delays as a result of products which are out of stock, unavailable
              or back ordered.

              and sell products or services. Torqis is only providing a platform for communication and it
              is agreed that the contract for sale of any of the products or services shall be a strictly

              enforcement officials (instead of refunding the same to Buyer) at the request of law
              enforcement officials or in the event the Buyer is engaged in any form of illegal activity.
              The Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Torqis will not be liable for any damages,

              • This happens across multiple touch points - both inside the Exaltride website (Notifications,
              Home Page, My Orders, Order Details) and outside the Website (Email, SMSs, PNs)
              • In case someone who has not purchased a particular product on Exaltride, attempts to
              review/rate a product on Exaltride, we do not allow it under any circumstances. These users see
              an error.
              Crowd-sourced Review Feedback
              • We allow users to give Thumbs-up & Thumbs-down against every review. This is used in
              calculation of Wilson Score that is one of the factors in the ranking the reviews
              • Flag as abusive: Users are allowed to flag reviews as abusive in case they find content that
              they find as abusive. These are then manually moderated and taken down in case they violate
              any guidelines.
              Moderation of Reviews
              Auto-moderation (Algorithmic pipeline)

              Manual moderation
              If the auto-moderation model is not confident enough (above a threshold) to categorize the text
              review in any of the categories, then it sends for manual moderation. All profane reviews go for
              manual moderation, even when auto-moderation model is able to categorize them.

              Disputes (Resolutions) Policy
              Overview
              Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Torqis. However, there may be some cases
              where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Torqis, we have a Dispute Resolution
              process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.
              What is a 'dispute'?
              A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a
              transaction on the Platform.
              How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
              Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise
              out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of
              their complaint/issue.
              It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue.
              Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on
              hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
              How is a 'dispute' created?
              Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can contact us through this link
              https://www.exaltride.com/helpcentre, while the Seller can write to
              sellergrivence.exaltride@gmail.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a
              particular transaction level.
              What are the various types of 'disputes'?
              Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:
              Wrong item received;
              Item not as described;
              Damaged or seal broken on Product;
              Part/accessory missing;
              Item not compatible;
              Seller description/specification wrong;
              Defective (functional issues)
              Product not working and manufacturer claims invalid Invoice.
              In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Torqis
              will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in
              favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute
              is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.
              Buyer Protection Program
              In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, Torqis will
              actively work towards reaching a resolution.
              The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their

              possible fraud and if the Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the
              Platform. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.
              CS team will not facilitate a conference call; CS team acts as the bridge between customer and
              seller.

              Torqis Infringement Verification - Reporting Listing Violations
              Torqis has put in place Torqis Infringement Verification process so that intellectual property
              owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in Torqis's interest to ensure that
              infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.
              If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see Torqis's FIV.
              Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products
              or listings through TIV. If you are not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still
              help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us.
              If your listing was removed through TIV, and you believe that your listing was removed in
              error, please contact us.
              In your notice of infringement, you shall be required to identify the individual listing which is
              infringing your intellectual property. General notices shall not be accepted.
              We are happy to receive such information, but must advise that we may be limited in Our ability
              to respond to your request absent formal notice from an authorized rights owner.
